# URLImageApp

URLImage is a SwiftUI view that automatically loads an image from provided URL.

This is also a demo app for my blog post: https://medium.com/@dmytro.anokhin/url-image-view-in-swiftui-f08f85d942d8

You need Xcode 11 to run this code. Also you need to fill your Bundle identifier. 

## Importing and using in your app

I will soon make this a package. For now to use it your app include contents of URLImage folder in your project.

Creating `URLImage` is simple:

```
URLImage(url)
```

See `ImageListView` for example how to use it in lists.
